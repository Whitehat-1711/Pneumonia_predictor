# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray

This project uses deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on grayscale images.

## Features:
- Upload chest X-ray images through a web interface.
- Get instant predictions on whether pneumonia is detected or not.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
